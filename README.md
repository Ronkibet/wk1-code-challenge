# Running challenge 1
- Run the application by calling the function which in this case will be console.log(gradeGenerator()) where the grade input will go in between the brackets attached to the function
You will then run node index.js in your terminal so as to actually see the output of said function.
You will then run node index.js in your terminal so as to actually see the output of said function.Alternetively, one can run npm start command to see the output.
# Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
# Running challenge 2
- Run the application by calling the function which in this case will be console.log(speedDetector()); where the speed input will go inbetween the brackets attached to the function
You will then run node index.js so as to actually see the output of said function.
You will then run node index.js or npm start so as to actually see the output of said function.


#  challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.
# Running challenge 3
- Run the application by calling the function which in this case will be console.log(Salary()); where the salary and benefits input will go inbetween the brackets attached to the function
You will then run node index.js in your terminal so as to actually see the output of said function.
You will then run node index.jsor npm start in your terminal so as to actually see the output of said function.
